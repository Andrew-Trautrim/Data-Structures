# Data-Structures
A simple class implementation of various data structures, including user methods to insert, delete, store, and manipulate the desired data structure.   
Data structures included:  
- Binary Tree  
  -  A tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Values larger than itself are stored in the right child and smaller values are stored to the left.
  -  Complexity:  
     Access:      O(n)    Θ(log(n))  
     Search:      O(n)    Θ(log(n))  
     Insertion:   O(n)    Θ(log(n))  
     Deletion:    O(n)    Θ(log(n))  
     Space:       O(n)
- Hash Table  
  - Complexity:  
    Access:      N/A     N/A  
    Search:      O(n)    Θ(1)  
    Insertion:   O(n)    Θ(1)  
    Deletion:    O(n)    Θ(1)  
    Space:       O(n)
- Linked List  
- Trie  
- K-Dimensional Tree
